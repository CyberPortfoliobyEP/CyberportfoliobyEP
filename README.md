  **_"Faithful unto death."_** - Sir Edward John Poynter (1836â€“1919)

   During the excavations at Pompeii in the early 19th century,  
   the skeleton of a soldier in full armour was discovered.  
   Romantic historians of the period assumed that he had  
  remained loyally at his post while all the other  
 inhabitants of Pompeii were fleeing from the eruption  
of Mount Vesuvius in 79 AD.
