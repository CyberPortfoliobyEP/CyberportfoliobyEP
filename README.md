        During the excavations at Pompeii in the early 19th century,  
        the skeleton of a soldier in full armour was discovered.  
        Romantic historians of the period assumed that he had  
        remained loyally at his post while all the other  
        inhabitants of Pompeii were fleeing from the eruption  
        of Mount Vesuvius in 79 AD.
