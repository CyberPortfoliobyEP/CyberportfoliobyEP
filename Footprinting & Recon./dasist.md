# Footprinting using Netcraft and DNSDumpster

## Host System

- **Device:** MacBook Air (M1, 2020)
- **Processor:** Apple M1
- **RAM:** 8 GB
- **Operating System:** macOS Sequoia 15.1.1
- **Browser:** Mozilla Firefox (used for all tasks)

## Virtual Machine

- **Software:** UTM (QEMU-based)
- **Guest OS:** Parrot Security OS

## Lab Objective

This lab demonstrates the process of extracting domain and subdomain information of a target organization using tools like Netcraft and DNSDumpster. The collected data can be used for reconnaissance purposes, enabling further penetration testing such as web application and network attacks.

4. **Extract Information**  
   - Review the results on the site report page.
   - Information such as background, hosting history, network details, and subdomains is displayed.

5. **View Subdomains**  
   - In the Network section, click on the target domain (`certifiedhacker.com`) to view a list of subdomains.
   - The results include subdomains, operating systems, and netblocks.

2. **Extract GeoIP and DNS Records**  
   - Scroll down to view:
     - DNS Servers
     - MX Records
     - Host Records (A)
     - IP Addresses
