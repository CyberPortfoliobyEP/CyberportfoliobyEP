- **Windows Autopatch Test – Test:** Assigned to Admin group.
- **Windows Autopatch Test – Last:** Assigned to End-user group.

**Deployment Types:**
- **Assigned:** Manual assignment of devices.
- **Dynamic:** Automatic assignment based on pre-defined rules.

> **Note:** The "Test" group receives updates first to identify issues, while "Last" ensures stability after validation.

## 4.3 Configuring Windows Update Settings

- **Approval Methods:**
  - **Automatic:** Streamlines update deployment without manual intervention.
  - **Manual:** Provides control over critical updates.
- **Deferral Period:** Configurable to delay updates for stability testing.

> **Note:** Granular control over driver updates minimizes compatibility issues.

## 4.5 Review + Create
